## General info
A game I've been creating for over a year now, but I'm determined to finish it before moving onto the next solo project!

I wanted to create a simple platformer that my 5 year old could play, recognise and enjoy. He even helps design the levels! Next to get him a Tshirt to secretely advertise Cubey in school...
